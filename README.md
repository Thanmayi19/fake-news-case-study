# Fake News Classification Case Study

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a case study on **fake news detection** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## Overview
The notebook covers:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Tokenization and lemmatization
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words
- Model training and evaluation using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations (Seaborn)

## Purpose
This project is part of a learning exercise to understand:
- Text preprocessing for NLP
- Transforming text into machine learning-ready features
- Comparing performance of different ML classifiers

## Dataset
- Publicly available dataset or sample data used in the course  
- Contains news articles labeled as `Fake` or `Real`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis
